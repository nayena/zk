# AWS Direct Connect

This is a service that offers a (or multiple) direct connection(s) to a customer office or data center.

AWS Direct Connect links are 1GBps or 10GBps links. Multiple of these are possible, for redundancy purposes. It supports IPsec VPN as well, but adds a layer of configuration complexity.

AWS Direct Connect does not allow you to configure the AWS end of the connection, which is why some may prefer a software-based VPN.
