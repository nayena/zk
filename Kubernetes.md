# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is greek for helmsman and is an opensource [[container]]-orchestration system. It can manage hundreds if not thousands of deployments and is built by Google for planet-scale operations.

Managing things inside kubernetes is done primarily using [[kubectl]] and kubernetes itself can be installed in a plethora of ways.
